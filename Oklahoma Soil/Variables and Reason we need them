Site: This variable represents the location where the data was collected. The location can be an important factor in determining the impact of drought on the soil.

Depth cm: This variable represents the depth at which the soil samples were collected. It is important to note that the depth of soil can affect how much moisture is available for plants, and therefore can be important in understanding the effects of drought on vegetation.

Sand %, Silt %, and Clay %: These variables represent the proportions of different types of soil particles in the soil. They are important because they affect soil structure, which in turn affects the amount of water that can be stored and the rate at which it can be released to plants.

BulkD g/cm3: This variable represents the bulk density of the soil, which is the mass of soil per unit volume. It is related to the porosity of the soil, and therefore can affect the amount of water that can be stored in the soil.

Th33 cm3/cm3 and Th1500 cm3/cm3: These variables represent the volumetric water content of the soil at field capacity and at wilting point, respectively. They are important in understanding the amount of water available to plants and how much water is needed to maintain plant growth.

Theta_r cm3/cm3 and Theta_s cm3/cm3: These variables represent the residual water content and saturated water content of the soil, respectively. They are important in understanding the water holding capacity of the soil.

Alpha 1/kPa: This variable represents the air entry value, which is the pressure at which water begins to be removed from the soil pores. It is related to the soil's ability to retain water, and therefore can be important in understanding the effects of drought on the soil.

N: This variable represents the porosity of the soil, which is the volume of the pore space relative to the total volume of the soil. It is important in understanding the water holding capacity of the soil.

Ks cm/day and Ko cm/day: These variables represent the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil, respectively. They are important in understanding the rate at which water can move through the soil.

L: This variable represents the depth of the soil layer being measured. It is important in understanding the effects of drought on different layers of the soil.

Year: This variable represents the year in which the data was collected. It can be important in understanding the long-term effects of drought on the soil.

By analyzing these variables, we can gain insights into how different soil properties and conditions affect the impact of drought on the soil and vegetation. This information can be used to develop strategies to mitigate the effects of drought and to manage water resources more effectively.

These variables can be useful in predicting drought.

By analyzing these variables and their relationships, it is possible to develop models that can help predict how soil properties will change under different drought conditions.
For example, the Theta_r cm3/cm3 and Theta_s cm3/cm3 variables can be used to estimate the water holding capacity of the soil,
which is an important factor in predicting how the soil will respond to drought.
Similarly, the Sand %, Silt %, and Clay % variables can be used to estimate soil structure,
which can affect how water is stored and released in the soil.
By combining these variables with weather data and other environmental factors,
it is possible to develop more accurate models for predicting drought and its effects on soil and vegetation.
