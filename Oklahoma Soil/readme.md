Since we discussed Vegetation, I found dataset from OSU. 

The varaibles are:
-The Depth Soil was collected
-Different Types of Soil
-Density of Soil
-Volumetric water content of soil
-Residual water content and saturated water content of soil
-Air pressure at which water begins to be removed from soil pores
-Volumne of Pore Space
-and more

This can be good to analyzing these variables and their relationships,
it is possible to develop models that can help predict how soil properties
will change under different drought conditions.
For example, the Theta_r cm3/cm3 and Theta_s cm3/cm3 variables
can be used to estimate the water holding capacity of the soil,
which is an important factor in predicting how the soil will respond to drought.
Similarly, the Sand %, Silt %, and Clay % variables can be used to estimate
soil structure, which can affect how water is stored and released in the soil.
By combining these variables with weather data and other environmental factors,
it is possible to develop more accurate models for predicting drought and
its effects on soil and vegetation.
